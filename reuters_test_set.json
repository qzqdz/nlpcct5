But the government has repeatedly said itwill not allow any banks to go under.The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling ofproblem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whetherdebtors have regular cash flows or not.Banks' shareholders and depositors will have their rightsguaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significancein a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sectoris the biggest after oil.Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to rideout the oil glut, bankers and economists say.Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned lastyear by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.But strategic diversification into downstream operations inEurope several years ago and a hefty refining investment athome gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sellover one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processedproduct such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than ascrude.Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reasonfor cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domesticinflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recentyears and signs government spending on productive sectors willremain steady.External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct belowthat for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hitGulf.Kuwait's petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were putofficially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment incomeof the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, thesereserves may not be enough to prevent a \"real\" budget deficit forthe 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.This left out income from state reserves, usually excludedin official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers atup to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in someshortfall.Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast foreconomic growth this year or next.\"It depends on oil prices,\" one said. \"This summer

The whole game is bringing out new products and improvingthe old ones.\"Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot ofpaints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hikeproduct prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demandfor some products such as styrene could push profit margins upby as much as 300 pct, he said.Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers inHouston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earnedlast year and predicted it would have the best year in itshistory.In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barreland chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. \"I believe the entirechemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,\"Oreffice said.GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemicalindustry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billiondlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemicalindustry has been brought about by a combination of luck andplanning, said Pace's John Dosher.Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocksdramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollarwas weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boostU.S. chemical exports.Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance hasbeen the gradual market absorption of the extra chemicalmanufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producersin the early 1980s.Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturershave embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring programto mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminateunrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry offriendly and hostile takeover attempts.GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquireUnion Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrsfor Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plasticsand chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R.

Specialty businesses do not stay special long.\"Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by theSterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyoutof Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plantsalong the Texas Gulf Coast.The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals thatare the building blocks of specialty products.\"This kind of commodity chemical business will never be aglamorous, high-margin business,\" Cain said, adding that demandis expected to grow by about three pct annually.Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, saidchemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand forplastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, woodand steel products.

Thecompany still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year inrestructuring and marketing, Heineken said.Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profitnext year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations hadalready turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by theEuropean Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beerinto the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beermarket -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. \"Wehave the beer, but distribution and sales is the importantpoint,\" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heinekenhad been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.\"The question is not if we want to penetrate the Germanmarket, but how we are to do it,\" van Schaik said, adding thatwhile the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing ataste for foreign beer, the internal structure was veryregionalized.Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible forAfrican operations, said he saw Africa as one of the mostimportant beer growth markets in the long term.He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and withmajority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, washampered by the lack of hard currencies there.Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine litersper head per year and sales are limited by import restrictionsand currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total1986 sales.On-site production is rendered expensive by the high priceof imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientistshave been looking at other possibilities.To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched onthe Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, whichhad sold successfully, Coebergh said.Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional rawmaterials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer werepopular in Rwanda . \"This is a possibility, but we could notpossibly achieve the Heineken flavor,\" Coebergh said.Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts topenetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in acontract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken'smarket potential.

But Volckerhas warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraughtwith danger.Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation asimported goods become more expensive and chase away foreigncapital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with othermajor industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value ofthe dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange ratesshould be stabilized at around current levels.As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed totake steps to stimulate their economies and the United Statesagreed to cut its budget deficit.The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as away to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, isto reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.\"If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything elseyou do is going to be counterproductive,\" Volcker said in recenttestimony before the Senate Banking Committee.Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten thegovernment's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the creditsupply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures orto assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the UnitedStates.Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off thecurrent modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressedthat any deficit reduction was better than none.But he said the size of the cuts under consideration werenot enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility itneeds to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollarfrom plunging further in world exchange markets.\"There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but ifyour objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve theFed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answeris, it's not enough,\" Silvia told Reuters.The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government'smost vexing and persistent problems.The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yetlittle indication that this year's figure will be any lower,though administration officials have predicted it will drop byabout 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end.In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleepworrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from thefederal budget.On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is notattached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set forthe 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balancedbudget law.While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs fornext year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate BudgetCommittees have conceded that their budget plans would fallshort of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.\"For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about themost you're going to get\" out of Congress at the present time,said Touche Ross's Collander. \"To do something more than thatwould be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult.\"Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end upshort of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.\"To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptablereduction level,\" he explained. \"Anything less than that will nowlook like a failure to Wall Street.\"The budget plan now under debate on the House floor wouldlower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the yearbeginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cuttingdefense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from theiranticipated spending levels for next year.The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit ofnearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in newtaxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.", "level4": ["trade"]}, {"title": "stewart and stevenson services &lt;ssss> 4th qtr", "abstract": "4th qtr ended Jan 31.Shr profit 72 cts vs profit 14 ctsNet profit 3,309,000 vs 609,000Revs 72 mln vs 65 mlnYearShr profit nil vs loss 4.13 dlrsNet profit 1,000 vs loss 19 mlnRevs 245 mln vs 269.1 mln", "level4": ["earn"]}, {"title": "westamerica bancorporation &lt;wsam> 1st qtr net", "abstract": "Shr 98 cts vs 63 ctsNet 2,602,000 vs 1,571,000Assets 1.15 billion vs 1.02 billionDeposits 1.04 billion vs 942.1 mlnLoans 834.8 mln vs 729.0 mlnReturn on avg assets 0.92 pct vs 0.63 pct", "level4": ["earn"]}, {"title": "colombia coffee registrations remain open", "abstract": "Colombia's coffee export registrationsremain open and there are no plans to close them since a newmarketing policy means an unlimited amount can be registered,Gilberto Arango, president of the private exporters'association said.\"The philosophy of the new policy is not to closeregistrations.

He added that West German growth forecasts wouldhave to be revised downward because of the recent dollar dropto 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange marketshad parted company with transactions in goods, services andinvestments. It was the scale of speculative transactions thatdetermined market trends.Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates togrow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rateswould have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.\"In other words, the monetary policy measures required aredifferent from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result ofmounting economic activity,\" Koehler said.The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciationgoing by talking the dollar down posed problems.The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steeprise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the costof European imports. But the volume effect of falling importsto the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time tomake itself felt compared with the price effect.\"Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be goingfurther than would be necessary to adjust the current accountover the medium term,\" Koehler said.A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occuronly if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand shouldrise faster than GNP.\"In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,\" Koehler said.If a further appreciation of the dollar was to beprevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset byan inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..But only if there was an appropriate interest ratedifferential would Europe and Japan look for financialinvestment in the U.S.When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bankhad to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact itsmeasures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market ratesby operating on the open market rather than adjusting leadinginterest rates because of the signal this gives to the marketand its substantial impact on exchange rates.It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals ofprice stability, economic growth and full employment but alsoto tackle international problems like the exchange rateproblem, the debt problem and the current account problem.A strategy had to be designed that helped \"the safeguardingof non-inflationary economic growth in an internationalmonetary system largely free of disruptions,\" Koehler said.Given the system of floating exchange rates, it wasnecessary for central banks to agree to intervene.

The yen sank below 145 at one pointdespite intervention by the Bank of Japan.Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's Finance Minister, said themovement since Paris was consistent with currency tradingranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks.\"I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the pastseveral weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in thediscussions in Paris,\" Miyazawa said yesterday.The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs wasannounced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve ofMiyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday'smeetings of leading industrial nations.In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action\"extraordinary and urgent\", the meeting reaffirmed the ParisAccord by noting that current exchange rates are within rangesbroadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, WestGermany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- thereforerepeated their willingness to continue close cooperation tofoster exchange rate stability.The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted centralbank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt thedollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale ofintervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recentyears. Monetary sources also said they understood thatSecretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremelysuccessful in the light of the Japanese announcement.They also said there was a growing feeling among thefinance ministers and central bankers that cooperation overmedium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-termdifferences in past meetings.West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything likethe yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face ofyesterday's statement to have won acceptance from othercountries that its exchange rate is acceptable.Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues thatmajor currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalancebetween West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America'strade deficit have already taken place.No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cutthe budget deficit even though it is implied in thereafffirmation of Paris.European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts areessential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall thatreached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier thisweek by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A furthersharp fall to redress trade imbalances would \"clearly posesubstantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and couldundermine confidence in future financial stability,\" he said.Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force thepolitically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germanywelcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its owncurrency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weakdollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, theJapanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on makingtheir policy coordination more binding and one, CanadianFinance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summitto prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.The United States and France, backed by the InternationalMonetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or \"norms\" for alimited number of economic objectives such as growth,inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and currentaccount balances.Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result inconsultations between the countries on whether correctiveaction should be required.But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectiveshas Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because itimplies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfullysounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limitcurrency fluctuations just before the February meeting.The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret rangesof the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from therelatively free currency markets of recent years.", "level4": ["yen", "dlr"]}, {"title": "bank of france leaves intervention rate unchanged", "abstract": "The Bank of France said it left itsintervention rate unchanged at 7-3/4 pct when it injected fundsin the market against first category paper in today's moneymarket intervention tender.Money market dealers had earlier expressed mixed views onthe possibility of quarter point cut.The rate was last adjusted on March 9, when it was cut to7-3/4 pct from the eight pct rate set in January.", "level4": ["interest"]}, {"title": "global economic slowdown raises new debt fears", "abstract": "The global economy is expected toweaken this year, adding new worries to an already seriouspoverty outlook, economic analysts said.For finance ministers and central bankers attending thisweek's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fundand World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add anadditional concern.The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pctthis year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, ameasure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product,another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0pct from 3.5 pct last year.The new figures are considered a major disappointment tothe poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in theindustrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oilprices would assist their economic recovery and help them copewith growing mounds of debt.IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believedthe industrial country economies would move up to an annualgrowth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for sometime that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning intoan economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthierstates for markets for their products as well as financialassistance, economic weakness in the developed nations'economies poses fundamental worries.Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, haveonly a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,including the key one of exports.The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but ittoo is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only2.3 pct, according to the IMF.For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, theUnited States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany toignite their economies but with little apparent success.The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar andthe curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. tradedeficit.Reagan administration officials have been saying that theimpact is now beginning to show up, although it has been muchslower than expected.The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that \"it hasto be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time towork through to payments flows -- probably at least three yearsto get a resonably complete effect.\"The report added, however, \"the adjustments may take evenmore time on this occasion.\"REUTER^M", "level4": ["gnp"]}, {"title": "spanish employers worried by high interest rates", "abstract": "The head of Spain's employers'federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worriedabout the government's monetary policies because high realinterest rates were hampering investment.He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far thisyear were not endangering the government's five pct inflationtarget. The government's perceived need to control inflation bykeeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.High real interest rates were attracting an influx ofspeculative foreign capital which was undercutting thegovernment's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply,liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and atarget range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call moneyrate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from11.8 at end-1986.Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call tohold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and newwage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanishworkers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected thestate sector, where the government is trying to impose its fivepct wage ceiling.Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend inSpain's foreign trade balance.

Butthe agony may be fairly drawn out,\" Marris told Reuters.Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later thisyear, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that itwould take very little to touch off what he calls the secondphase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in thedollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop onMarch 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent withhistorical experience, which teaches that domestic markets arenot affected until a currency is in the final stages of itsdecline, Marris said.

Thetariffs were placed on items which were available from othersources so there would be little effect on the Americanconsumer, Fitzwater said.Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action- especially against Japan - to end global unfair tradepractices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit.The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would.The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billiondlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for aboutone-third of America's overall deficit.But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, WestGermany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said thepresident is ready to fight them all.Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that \"I regretthat these actions are necessary,\" but that the health andvitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential toAmerican competitiveness in world markets.\"We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair tradingpractices,\" Reagan added in the statement from his Californiavacation home at Santa Barbara.He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japanabided by the agreement.U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress -which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that healready has the tools needed to fight unfair trade.The White House aide said of the tariff action, \"it wasn'tdone to appease Congress, but

"fed data provide new evidence of tighter policy", "abstract": "U.S. banking data released today aretoo distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetarypolicy, but they do support the market's assumption that theFederal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit,economists said.\"It's clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discountwindow borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rateaverage and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistentwith a modest tightening,\" said Dana Johnson of First ChicagoCorp.Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate thatthe Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct.Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-weekstatement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week ofDecember 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously.Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billiondlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total thisyear - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at theFed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more inreserves than the Fed had anticipated.However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fedis aiming for much lower discount window borrowings thanwitnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may haveforced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week.First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the weekended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs,partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of theproceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions topay annual income taxes.As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do thereserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed.Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billiondlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economistssaid the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of theprojected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started toadd reserves too late.Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparentlyleft Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with whichto enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economistssaid. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of reposoutstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to addeven more reserves but was prevented from doing so.\"It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add asmuch as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,\"said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targettingdiscount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day,equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct.After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has nottightened credit to the degree suggested by the data,economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arrangingovernight injections of reserves until the last day of thestatement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced thatthe Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today'sfigures, he said, \"It's fair to say that the Fed may be movingtoward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture.\"Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rateunless the dollar's fall gathers pace.Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing politicalopposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a timewhen Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key toreducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.", "level4": ["money-supply"]}, {"title": "rorer group inc &lt;ror> 1st qtr net", "abstract": "Oper shr profit 34 cts vs loss 78 ctsOper net profit 7,434,000 vs loss 17.0 mlnRevs 201.2 mln vs 171.7 mlnNote: Year-ago oper exludes gain on sale of businesses of139.6 mln.Year-ago oper includes charges of 27.8 mln resulting fromallocation of the purchase price of Revlon's businesses toinventory and 7.1 mln for restructuring costs.", "level4": ["earn"]}, {"title": "mild coffee growers to meet in guatemala", "abstract": "A large group of \"other milds\"coffee-growing nations will hold talks in Guatemala next monthto map their strategy for next September's meeting of theInternational Coffee Organisation (ICO).Mario Fernandez, executive director of the Costa Ricancoffee institute, said delegates from Mexico, the DominicanRepublic, Peru, Ecuador, India, Papua New Guinea and fivecentral american nations will participate in the two-daystrategy session beginning May 4.The main topic will be reform of what many producingcountries perceive as the ICO's unfair distribution of exportquotas, Fernandez said.He said Costa Rica would press for quotas \"based on thereal production and export potential of each country in thepast few years\" and to distribute quotas based on \"historic\"production levels rather than recent harvests and cropestimates.", "level4": ["coffee"]}, {"title": "us study discusses dropped comsat-contel merger", "abstract": "A congressional study today said theproposed, but now apparently abandoned, merger of theCommunications Satellite Corp &lt;CQ> and Contel Corp &lt;CTC>would technically be legal but could violate the spirt of thelaw setting up COMSAT.Two weeks ago before the study was completed, Contelannounced it would seek to terminate the proposed merger.The study by the non partisan Congressional ResearchService (CRS) said \"the proposed merger appears to comply,technically, with the mandates or letter of statutes, if maynevertheless violate the spirit of the law.\"Comsat, created by a 1962 act of Congress, and Contel, acorporation of local telephone and communications firms, filedwith the Federal Communications Commission last November 3 anapplication for merger.

Hutton analystTerence Quinn.That field is a segment of the market known as systemutilities, or software packages that boost the productivity ofa company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed,power and efficiency of large mainframe computers.The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines thetwo biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM.Analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms thatwill find the competition much harder than in the past.For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps asix-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City,N.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry.When the deal is completed sometime in August, thecompany's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it pastMicrosoft Corp &lt;MFST> as the world's largest independentsoftware vendor.Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wangtook the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3mln dlrs for the year ended March 31.Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computerbusinesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframecomputer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp.Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after themerger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth.On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of sixcompanies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs.For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, onsales of 141.5 mln dlrs.The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largelybecause the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also,Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from thedark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or56 cts a share.At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 differentbusinesses, only three of which were involved in computersoftware. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and amajor Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from hisjob as chairman of General Electric Co's &lt;GE> computer servicesunit.Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at anews conference that the merger would give computer users asingle source for a wide range of software products.In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates alsosell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroadsin the applications software market, where analysts said it hasbeen successful with accounting and banking systems.Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support andenhance both companies' product lines, but noted that thecompany will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He saidabout 20 pct of the companies' products overlap.Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings ofcurrent Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. Butthey joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not diluteComputer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year.Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record ofcompleting acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore,he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05dlrs a share.Wang said he would look closely at the combined operationsof the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketingand research and development.Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.Based on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share.Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said mostsoftware companies are currently valued at about 20 timesper-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth thepremium because of its earnings potential and customer base.Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currentlyowns 58 pct of Uccel.The executive said the merger would not alter his target ofmaintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct.In addition, he said he expects no problems in having thedeal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. JusticeDepartment.Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after themerger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang.", "level4": ["acq"]}, {"title": "maxwell would not renew bid if suit fails", "abstract": "British press magnate Robert Maxwell saidhis British Printing and Communication Corp Plc would not renewits bid for Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc &lt;HBJ> if the lawsuitfiled against Harcourt in New York today fails.Speaking at a press conference, Maxwell denied marketrumors that British Printing had approached Britishinstitutions to arrange a rights issue with a view torelaunching its bid for the U.S. publishing concern.\"I don't believe in chasing mirages,\" maxwell said.British Printing filed suit in U.S. District Court inManhattan to block what Maxwell called a fraudulentrecapitalization announced by Harcourt last week.Harcourt, in response to a hostile two billion dlr takeoverproposal from Maxwell, planned a recapitalization that wouldpay shareholders 40 dlrs per share.

Heavyinflows, particularly in January around the time of the EMSrevaluation, boosted domestic money supply.\"There is still a certain hope that the net inflow offoreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bitreversed,\" Schlesinger said.A major reason for the inflows was the market's convictionthat the mark was headed higher. \"As we can see from the market,expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark havediminished,\" Schlesinger said.The recent widening of interest rate differentials, thefact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short periodand an improvement in real trade balances have all combinedtowards stabilizing the dollar, he said.Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollarrise, as the U.S. Did in March when the dollar rose above 1.87marks, he said this would depend on the circumstances.At midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks.\"Central banks are always in contact about thesefluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react,\"Schelsinger said.\"One has to look at how it (the market) is moving,\" he said,adding, \"It is not only our own case, it is also the Americancase.\"He said that the West German export industry has been hithard by the dollar's sharp fall and would probably like to seesome correction now. \"But it wouldn't be good to have short-termfluctuations,\" he said. \"Let us wait and see.\"\"It is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a veryshort period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level(of rates) as such,\" Schlesinger said.The sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices ofsuch key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on WestGerman inflation down year.Although there have recently been signs of inflationpicking up, he said that this was due to changes in keycommodity prices. The underlying inflation rate this year wouldbe unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said.Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growthwas longer term, in that the economy was building up thepotential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation.The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness oftargets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at themid-year meeting of the Bundesbank's council, Schlesigner said.But he added: \"I don't see any great pressure to go awayfrom it.\"", "level4": ["gnp", "interest"]}, {"title": "japan oil industry decontrol may lead to mergers", "abstract": "Deregulation of Japan's oil industry couldmean hardship for smaller firms and lead to their merging intobigger refining and marketing groups, industry sources said.They said the relaxation of controls was now under reviewby the Petroleum Council, an advisory panel to the Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry (MITI).A spokesman for a major firm said, \"Deregulation would bringabout a reorganization.

But officials noted that Poehl has workedclosely and successfully with Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982.Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from PaulVolcker of the United States, enjoys a strong internationalreputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlookPoehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat ChancellorWilly Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he wasFinance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, asChancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980.In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against thedollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern ofthe Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institutionwhich has doggedly pursued monetary policies to preventinflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two boutsof galloping inflation this century.But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, andinflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safeto relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on thedangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate.\"I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise thedollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for theBundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the markwould endanger the economy in West Germany,\" he told businessjournalists in Frankfurt recently.Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says thatPoehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.\"Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does notfocus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the externaleconomy,\" she said.An economist at a German bank, who declined to beidentified, said \"If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it willcertainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not sorigidly oriented towards money supply.\"One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been topersuade the United States to stop \"talking down\" the dollar. ForPoehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was thatthe United States agreed to join efforts to stabilisecurrencies.The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currencydealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But infact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.\"This is because the markets know - or perhaps because theydon't know - what the central banks can do,\" Poehl says ofintervention in currency markets which can quickly turn ratesround, making a speculator's position worthless.Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalistin the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes overa glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football andplay golf.Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitutefor correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.\"But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amountif you strike at the right moment,\" he said.

This would leave a budget deficitbefore borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct ofGDP.The government, having consistently overshot its ownspending targets for more than a decade, also faces acredibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in thebudget, analysts said.\"The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,\"said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview.Many analysts in the private sector are now paying lessattention to the figures presented in the budget and are usingtheir own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for themoney and capital markets.South African Mutual's Lee believes government spendingwill again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49billion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5pct of GDP, compared with a three pct limit suggested by theIMF.\"The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned,\" predictedone analyst, noting that South Africa has moved steadily awayfrom austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the pasttwo years.The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in thepolitical situation and the onset of an economic crisistriggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll overloans to the country in September 1985.Against a background of Western economic sanctions, fallingper capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation,government officials say economic growth is the primeobjective.But private-sector economists caution that the government'sability to promote growth by boosting state spending isconstrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on thecurrent account of the country's balance of payments.Most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5billion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on thenation's estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of anarrangement reached earlier this year with major internationalcreditor banks.Within these constraints, economists believe Du Plessis haslittle room to manoeuvre.Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries andbudgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office andSouth African Transport Services suggest that major taxconcessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely.Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessionsfor taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-onlyelection.

when its central bank council meets on Thursdayfor its last session before the Venice summit, bankingeconomists and money market dealers said.The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last monthby cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and isunlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest ratesin the near future, they said.The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting willbe followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT.But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference wasusually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, anddid not necessarily herald any policy moves.Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said todaythere was no reason to cut interest rates because money supplygrowth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar wasstable against the mark.Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank hasopened a representative office, that the West German economywas now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted1/2 to one pct in the first quarter.Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold ina 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month, after theBundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at aminimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct.\"They have set this signal and indicated they could maybelower market rates even further, but not with the discount orLombard,\" Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder,Munchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said.Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, saidGerman rates were among the lowest in industrial countries andaround historical lows for West Germany.A further cut in rates would have little impact on theeconomy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand,with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said.The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a moveon interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve.\"The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder,\" he said.A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them inline with the new structure of money market rates since lastmonth, would have little practical significance, dealers said.The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted adiplomatic gesture before next week's Venice summit.But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made itclear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere \"eyewash.\"Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government tocut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetarypolicy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit.But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced taxcuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budgetdeficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further.\"The Bonn government will be in a very weak position inVenice because they can't risk increasing the deficit further,\"said Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst's Hutmann.Bethmann's Chrobok said if anything is to happen beforeVenice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. \"But Idon't expect any convincing measures,\" he said.Money market dealers noted that call money continued tonormalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterdayand as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up bymonth-end distortions.Call money could come under upwards pressure later thismonth because of a major round of tax payments by banks onbehalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15.Two public holidays that week could also distort the market.Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate fundstomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct,and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact.But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank wouldallocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would notrepresent a tightening of policy, however.Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocatesat the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a fullallocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said.On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likelyto lift restrictions on private use of the European CurrencyUnit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon.Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcementon this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of theSaarland bordering France, and was twice under Frenchoccupation this century.But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to comethis week, as a number of technical and legal matters had stillto be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would betreated for minimum reserve purposes.", "level4": ["money-fx", "interest"]}, {"title": "alcan reduces cost of planned smelter", "abstract": "Alcan Aluminium Ltd said it has cut theexpected cost of its planned Laterriere, Quebec, smelter byusing enhanced Grande Baie reduction technology.The company said the decision to use prebaked anodetechnolgy used at its Grande Baie, Quebec, and Sebree, Ky.,smelters was taken primarily for cost reasons.As a result, it said, the estimated total cost of theplanned smelter will be held to 450 mln U.S. dlrs, the low endof the range estimated in mid-May, while the cost of the firstphase was cut to 150 mln dlrs from the projected 175-225 mlndlrs.", "level4": ["alum"]}, {"title": "german experts say no further economic stimulus", "abstract": "The West German government's independentcouncil of economic experts believes a further stimulation ofthe economy is inappropriate, government spokesman FriedhelmOst said.A statement released by Ost after a meeting of ChancellorHelmut Kohl and senior government officials with the councilsaid the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1-1/2 to twopct was achievable.It added the council believed \"an intensification of thealready expansionary stimulation of monetary and financialpolicy is not called for.\"Ost's statement said experts believed further pressure onWest Germany to adapt to external economic factors would notincrease.The government regularly uses the term \"changed externaleconomic factors\" when referring to the fall of the dollar,which has severely damaged West German exports.

Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grainssubcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheatand corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrsand 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza hassaid the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely tobe approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers anda strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who saidfreezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other majorgrain export competitors and would not achieve the budgetsavings Glickman claims.Another area where Glickman and other have said budgetsavings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,ARP, levels for wheat and corn.However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong standwithin the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 cropwheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Mostcommodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.Congressional sources said the only way to achievesignificant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boostthe 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source saidsingling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen asunfair to one commodity.Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is mostlikely to eventually look for budget savings are sometightening of the payment limitation rules, and possibleadoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billionbut not enough, they said.Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculturecommittees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut onall Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including pricesupport loans and deficiency payments, similar to theGramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.This idea has been suggested by the American Farm BureauFederation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities.", "level4": ["corn", "grain"]}, {"title": "u.s. first time jobless claims rose in week", "abstract": "New applications for unemploymentinsurance benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 340,000 in theweek ended June 6 from 310,000 in the prior week, the LaborDepartment said.The number of people actually receiving benefits underregular state programs totaled 2,359,000 in the week ended May30, the latest period for which that figure was available.That was up from 2,255,000 the previous week.", "level4": ["jobs"]}, {"title": "opec differentials not seen posing major problems", "abstract": "Some OPEC states are unhappy about theprices assigned to their crude oil but this should not posegreat problems when the group reviews its six-month-old priceand output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say.They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conferencepresidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievancesabout price differentials making some of their crudesuncompetitive.There has also been speculation by Japanese traders thatOPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes,to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices.But most experts agree that a major overhaul of pricedifferentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the marketsignals of a dent in OPEC's new unity.\"All OPEC members can make a good case for changingdifferentials,\" said one analyst with a major oil company. \"Butat the end of the day, the attitude is going to be \"leave wellalone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered.\"Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also sawsales problems earlier this year, traders say.

But many experts say OPEC shouldchange prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand forfuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. Atits last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixedprices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel referencepoint. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985when members offered discounts to attract customers.OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarterand 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extendor raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.Spot market and netback values for some crudes do notmirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlrtarget and at most make minimal changes to differentials,analysts say.The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and onenon-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key exportcrudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.Extra heavy crudes were among those left out.Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oilexports actually sold at official prices. Several experts sayonly one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells atofficial prices, with some of the rest included in processingor barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance topay the new prices.Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude-- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank belowits 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output hasrisen.Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and sayits price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's KleinwortGrieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push thedifferentials question in Vienna.\"It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, whichholds the presidency, raised the issue,\" he said.", "level4": ["crude"]}, {"title": "new zealand budget forecast seen as positive", "abstract": "Analysts said they were surprised atthe government's announcement of a forecast budget surplus forfiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policystatements and positive for the economy.Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplusfor the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrsagainst a 1.95 billion deficit last year.Analysts polled by Reuters said the forecast budget surpluswas even more positive than the most bullish analysts'forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets.Market expectations among analysts questioned by Reutersbefore the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a2.3 billion dlr deficit.

In 1990 the Community's \"standstill\"agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would thenfeel the full impact of its enlargement.The Commission has proposed several cost and productioncutting measures which include the introduction of a maximumguaranteed quantity system, he added.Under the Commission's system for stabilising consumerprices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghesaid.Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatoryamount when market prices are below or above this level.He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatoryamount would be used to finance the Common AgriculturalPolicy's oils and fats regime.\"The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to theproposed tax) have for the most part been based on incompleteor an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal,\" he said.Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules.It would not be discriminatory because it would be appliedto domestic and imported products, and past experience showedit would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats.EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they dounder present aid arrangements, he said.The competitiveness between different oils, whether ECproduced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantitiesimported from third countries would not be affected by the tax,Tanghe said.The proposed system would not alter the EC nations'requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overalleffect would stabilise Community production levels withoutaffecting demand, he said.It is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain currentimport levels, he said.Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they areimported primarily to satisfy the EC's cakes and mealsrequirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system.Furthermore, more than half the oil produced from importedbeans is re-exported to third countries, Tanghe added.", "level4": ["veg-oil"]}, {"title": "union pacific &lt;unp> raises crude oil prices", "abstract": "Union Pacific Resources, formerlyChamplin Petroleum, said it raised posted prices for crude oilby 50 cts a barrel, effective yesterday.The price increase brings West Texas Intermediate, the U.S.benchmark grade, to 19.00 dlrs a barrel.The posted price increase follows a similar move by severalother oil companies.Sun Co was the first to raise crude oil postings yesterdayafternoon and today many other companies are following.The last price increase made by oil companies was aroundMay 22.", "level4": ["crude"]}, {"title": "marathon raises crude oil postings 50 cts/bbl, wti now", "abstract": "19.00 DLRS.MARATHON RAISES CRUDE OIL POSTINGS 50 CTS/BBL, WTI NOW19.00 DLRS.", "level4": ["crude"]}, {"title": "vaalian balance of payments in deficit in may", "abstract": "Italy's overall balance of payments showeda deficit of 3,211 billion lire in May compared with a surplusof 2,040 billion in April, provisional Bank of Italy figuresshow.The May deficit compares with a surplus of 1,555 billionlire in the corresponding month of 1986.For the first five months of 1987, the overall balance ofpayments showed a surplus of 299 billion lire against a deficitof 2,854 billion in the corresponding 1986 period.", "level4": ["trade", "bop"]}, {"title": "italian net official reserves fall in may", "abstract": "Italy's net official reserves fell to67,110 billion lire in May from a previously reported 68,455billion in April, the Bank of Italy said.Gold holdings totalled 35,243 billion lire at end May,unchanged from end April.Convertible currencies totalled 18,277 billion lire in May,down from 20,028 billion in April, while European Currency Unitholdings were 10,610 billion against 10,528 billion.", "level4": ["reserves"]}, {"title": "fed says it sets two billion dlrs of customer repurchase", "abstract": "AGREEMENTSFED SAYS IT SETS TWO BILLION DLRS OF CUSTOMER REPURCHASEAGREEMENTS", "level4": ["interest", "money-fx"]}, {"title": "becor western &lt;bcw>again adjourns holder meeting", "abstract": "Becor Western Inc said itsreconvened shareholders meeting has been adjourned to 1000 CDTJune 30.The company had previously announced plans to again adjournthe meeting following receipt of a renewed offer from LynchCorp &lt;LGL> yesterday.The meeting was originally convened on June four whenshareholders approved the sale of Becor's Western Gear Corpsubsidiary before adjourning.

Miningis monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of thecountry's foreign exchange earnings.Production has also been seriously affected in recent yearsby equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages ofspare parts, fuel and lubricants. The 463,354 tonnes outputlast year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes.A five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984by ZCCM is being funded by the European Community, the AfricanDevelopment Bank and the World Bank.The plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining andmetallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable.ZCCM, the second largest employer after the government, hassaid it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce aspart of the plan.More than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into theindustry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability underthe five-year restructuring plan.Company officials said although reserves were beingdepleted, Zambia could continue to produce copper beyond theend of the century, though at lower levels of production.Industry sources said ZCCM's projected pre-tax profit forthe financial year ended March 31 would be around 500 mlnkwacha.

year is likely to expand a modest 2.5pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke,the Bank of America economist who wrote the report.\"Growth in consumer spending in the United States

will see its gas costs up sharply as a result ofTransco Energy Co's &lt;E> decision to close its pipelines totransport spot gas sales, energy industry analysts said.Brooklyn Union, the fourth largest gas utility in theUnited States, purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot, ornon-contract, market in 1986, and the proportion of spotsupplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987,analysts said.Texas Eastern pipelines &lt;TET>, the other competingpipeline, to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the Southclosed its gate station for summer, and Brooklyn Union hasrelied entirely on Transco for spot supplies.In the month of May, Brooklyn Union paid about two dlrsper mln British Thermal Unit for spot gas, while contract gascosts four to five dlrs per mln BTU, industry sources said.Transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide openaccess to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fearof accumulating more take-or-pay liabilities.Take-or-pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers forgas even if delivery is not taken by its customers.Brooklyn Union will continue receiving a small amount ofsupplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause, aBrooklyn Union official said.Foster Corwith, gas analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, saidmost of the rising cost to Booklyn Union will be passed throughto rate payers.While net effect on the company will not be known forseveral months because of the time lag in deferred earnings,end-users, especially residential and commercial customers,will end up paying more for gas, he said.Because the closure takes place in summer months when gasdemand is at seasonal low, the impact on cash flow would besmall, Curt Launer, natural gas analyst with Donaldson LufkinJenrette, said.If the situation persists into winter heating season, highcost gas could cut in the company's profits, he said.Gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on Transco forspot gas, such as North Carolina Natural Gas Co

customers capable of shifting toalternative fuels, he said.In absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission, the matter is beingnegotiated between

U.S. Lenders,mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as lowas three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in theirportfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct toinduce them to retain their accounts.As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or wereforced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whoserates would move in line with the cost of funds.\"We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,\"said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society,explaining why his institution, for the time being, is onlyoffering variable rate mortgages.The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helpedhomebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lendersconcede they are being forced to undercut each other stillmore.Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlierthis week by the nation's two largest building societies and byNational Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition fornew business, officials at all three institutions said.The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates evenbelow those on the variable rate loans.\"Of course they are less profitable than other (variablerate) mortgages,\" said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, whichearlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed ratenew mortgage loans.But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitableloans because, \"It was just another way to attract people to ourmortgage product.\"Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixedrate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year.The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans wasexhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman.\"Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage,\" she said, notingthat within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pctof its 1986 volume.In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that theyoffer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interestrates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made thelender is earning an above average return on assets.But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has wonthe benefit of cheap money.Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixedrate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumptionthat a Conservative Party victory would help money market ratesfall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director.Young explained that the company had planned to protectitself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying acomplicated hedging instrument.But money market rates have risen contrary to expectationsand the company has shelved its plans for the time being. Hesaid money market rates were too high to arrange both themortgages and hedge profitably.However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co doesmake fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. Thismeans bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bondand selling them to an investor.For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and moreefficient with fixed rate rather than with floating ratemortgages.

The price gyrations havecombined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedentedvolatility to some U.S. securities markets.At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by somelawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporatetakeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeoverssteadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreignexchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundworkfor an international securities marketplace in which tradingoccurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investmentopportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforceU.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financialdisclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted tospur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency'sreview of hostile corporate takeovers.Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Huttoninvestment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective tothe agency upon being named chairman in 1981.In line with the views of other top administrationofficials, he favored marketplace determination of takeoverbattles over new federal regulations.The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insidertrading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases thattopped the agency's enforcement agenda during theadministration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted withRuder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely tosignificantly alter the commission's current priorities.The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of themlawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though thatfigure likely will be significantly higher next year as theagency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.The agency is one of the few in the government thatactually has taken in more money than it has spent in the pastfew years because of fees it charges public companies,investment banks and other securities firms it regulates.The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by thepresident to fixed five-year terms and protected from firingfor policy differences alone.By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the samepolitical party, and the agency prepares its own budget requesteach year instead of leaving this to the White House.Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its originsto the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributedin large part to widespread trading on credit and attemptedmarket manipulations by large investment firms.The agency requires public companies and investmentvehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports ontheir financial condition and to disclose changes in theircondition any time they issue new securities.It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks toregister with it and comply with investor protection rules, andit polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrialmagnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later tobecome the nation's 35th president.Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who servedfrom 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon'sfirst term and was Reagan's director of the CentralIntelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.", "level4": ["acq"]}, {"title": "u.s. asks congress to revise tariff categories", "abstract": "The Administration asked Congress toreplace the U.S. tariff schedule with a new system to bring itinto line with international tariff categories, U.S. TradeRepresentative Clayton Yeutter said.The new system will add such items as fiber optics and moreaccurately define new composites, items not widely traded whenthe current schedule was devised some 30 years ago.Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule iscalled, will change tariff categories and definitions to meetthe present-day needs of exporters and importers, but theyshould pay about the same rates of duties.Yeutter said, \"American exporters will find it far easier todeal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety ofdiffering systems which they now face.\"He said the new system ended 12 years of multinationalnegotiations to create the unified tariff schedule.Yeutter said government and business moves are based ondata from tariff schedules and the new system will improveknowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making.He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards underthe new system, with about half expected to join the system byJanuary 1988.", "level4": ["trade"]}, {"title": "service resources&lt;src> unit cuts sorg&lt;srg> stake", "abstract": "A group led by Chas.

the economy from tipping into a recession?\" said LyleGramley, chief economist of the Mortgage BankersAssociation and a former Federal Reserve Board official.The Commerce Department said this week that the economygrew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, buta U.S. monetary official called it a weak report.Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spendingrose a weak 0.1 per cent.\"Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing --are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, \"Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics,told Reuters.Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slowbecause inflation is rising faster than real wages.To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise,returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boostpersonal income and consumption, he says.\"I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports tokeep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,\"Gramley said.Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reportersthat the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was theresult of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not lastand said the recovery was showing anemia.Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, \"The paceof the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored intomonetary policy\" - possibly a signal that the Fed will beaccommodative.Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pctforecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that ifthe dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and addto the risk of a recession.Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in Maycame despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where aninventory overhang still exists.He says the boost in production came from smallerindustries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which haveimproved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar.\"They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge ineconomic activity, but I think they will keep us out of arecession,\" Mauro said.In a speech to financial planners this week, BerylSprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted thetrade deficit will continue to improve.\"Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 andinto 1988 are still quite favorable,\" he said.But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence ininflation.Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman BrothersInc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989

viewedskeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts andtrade sources.\"Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters andimporters, are adamant against voluntary compliance because ofthe past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as itbecame a matter of the trade monitoring each other,\" oneanalyst said.On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter saidthe Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement avoluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation tomonitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill.Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffeeimporters would voluntarily present needed documents to theU.S. government until Congress approves the monitoringauthority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification,it will still be allowed entry.While many believe producers will not seek to add to theoverburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe somewill ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu ofmonitoring controls, trade sources said.\"Last time, there was a lot of false information submittedto customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines,\" aU.S. Customs spokesman said.\"Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but whenits hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demandForm O (documents tracking merchandise from source todestination),\" he said.Many see it as a true test of whether producers andimporters will abide by the quota system.\"It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in thequota agreement,\" said one major U.S. roaster.\"Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade didnot act as a gentleman,\" said another analyst adding, \"withoutthe need to submit documents, the ball will be in theproducers' hands.\"Some feel that importers will take advantage of thevoluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market,in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount.Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-membercountries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falselylabelled.According to customs officials, several green coffeeimporters confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffeefraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations,forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navybeans.\"If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices forone country and another, producers may be teted to get rid oftheir stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and bycircumventing the quota provisions,\" said Paine Webber analystBernie Savaiko.Still, others believe that producers will not be hardpressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation inthe U.S. in the near term.\"It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would nothave some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary systemseemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have somuch coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of

It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven -the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency marketsand the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours tradingin New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar wasquoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday.Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at DeutscheGenossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on worldstock markets had been the main reason for the fall in WestGerman short-term interest rates on Tuesday.\"The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock marketlosses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fitswith Baker's wishes, then all the better,\" he said.No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and theBundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following risesin the U.S., Aschoff said.Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the centralbank has no interest in higher capital market rates and hethought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First BostonLtd in London said \"The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreatand Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as thesecurity repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it wasbefore the IMF meeting last month in Washington.\"Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord wasreaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidityat 3.60 pct, Keating noted.Economists said the United States now appeared to haveagreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and supportthe dollar in return for the German action on interest rates.Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinderWashington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenbergtold a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not ruleout central banks of leading industrial countries interveningon exchange markets to defend the dollar's value.Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed WestGermany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currencystability.

Under the deal, Argentina will benefit fromimproved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular thequota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef willbe increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reducedlevies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina saidthat Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected theirexports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. Theyhave been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade).But officials said ministers had been unable to resolveCanadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain hadbeen affected by the country's EC membership.Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on thefish dispute with Canada.Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan.

That, Ithink, was partly due to statements that have been made bysenior figures on the other side of the Atlantic.\" It was adispute that should never have happened, he added.Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at ahastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, hestill faced a storm of criticism on his return to the UnitedStates on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip toScandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis.Said one U.S. analyst of Baker's weekend remarks, \"Histiming could not have been worse.\"One government bond salesman in New York said, \"He actuallythought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smackthe dollar down would work. That doesn't show muchunderstanding of international monetary gamesmanship.\"However, some analysts said West Germany's stubborn marchtoward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand.\"On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but ifyou go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financialmarkets), it was West German policy,\" said Robert Brusca ofNikko Securities International in New York.\"All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, somaking him responsible for it was a little like killing themessenger,\" he said.After Monday's talks, the U.S. and West German governmentsmade it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced togetherin Paris in February, was still in effect.Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might bea prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar tothe late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crashwiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values.Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy aboutBonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep theglobal recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interestrate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite.He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59thmonth, could no longer be the only engine of global economicexpansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a hugemarket for debtor country exports.Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worriedthat the Republican party might face next year's presidentialelection with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badlytarnished.A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debtcrisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that hasalready slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate.\"There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on theeconomy, and it's important that the psychology turn aroundquickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, andeventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,\"former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in atelevision interview.In many ways, the official response was mild.Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat,with President Reagan speaking for most people by admittingthat he was \"puzzled.\"U.S. government sources said the secretary immediatelyreturned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developmentsand, presumably, their political impact.For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker's status inWashington will diminish because of the market fall.Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll becauseof the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator LloydBentsen said with some irony, \"Oh, I think it's much too late tobe doing that...You have an administration that's taken theattitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and ---retire to the living room to take a nap.

It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks.The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the marketreacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interestrates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said thatWest Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord.Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged tocoordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, withthe surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulatingtheir economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budgetdeficit.West German government sources said rising West Germanmoney market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvrepact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interestrates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been risingsince May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fedraised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50.German yields have also risen over this period, but lessmarkedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged upshort-term rates by changing the terms on its securityrepurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering themoney market.The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,compared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany'sinability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in theBundesbank central bank council about excessive monetarygrowth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,bank economists said.This monetary tightening reflected a switch from thepragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehlsince early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to themore cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger.In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity thismorning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises.\"They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too muchunder American fire,\" said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser atSwiss Bank Corp here.\"It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite asignificant retreat from its position,\" added Giles Keating,economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London.The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms ofthe Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pacton Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money marketeconomists said.Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbankdoes not want a further strong rise in the tender allocationrate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility.The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indicationthat the meeting would take place, although the FinanceMinistry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked tocomment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvreaccord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying heassumed monetary cooperation would continue.The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left WestGermany for Sweden on Monday.

Department said just 10 pct of one sectionof the structure remained.U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after anAmerican helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S.forces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said hadbeen caught laying mines.But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defenseofficials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkwormmissiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursdayand the Sea Isle City on Friday.Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, akey backer of Iraq in its war with Iran.Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle Eastnow with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaititankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping.But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the levelof violence and threats to shipping had increased as a resultof U.S. intervention and Iran's response.The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of aU.S. \"tit-for-tat\" policy that gave Iran the initiative, saidHarlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS.He said with this appraoch America would suffer \"the deathof one thousand cuts.\"But for the United States to grab the initiativemilitarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran'sharbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which itsshipping must pass, Schuler said.He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringingIran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off,Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq.Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomaticinitiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose anarms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate.He said the United States should also threaten to mine andblockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq toacknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of asettlement.Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war byinvading Iran's territory in 1980.

as a bilateral problembetween the United States and West Germany and insisted thatthe currency pact was still alive.U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the marketfears when he attacked the

He called for \"a faithfuland firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to theLouvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit.\"Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the BritishTreasury commented on the row.But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despiteU.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, \"this doesnot represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of theLouvre Accord.\"In Frankfurt F.

He must follow a policy that is notentirely his own,\" said another economist.The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the markand hurting West German exporters.The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since theBundesbank's new tack became clear in early October.Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary JamesBaker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany tostimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a roundof tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult forStoltenberg than he had bargained for.The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly votedmost popular government politician last year, had to faceresistance from local barons in the government coalitionparties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising4.3 billion marks.But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it willpush up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs thegovernment could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political rowwhich has turned into the country's worst political scandal.Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington lastmonth early to sort out a row in the northern state ofSchleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign afterallegations of a \"dirty tricks\" election campaign led to heavylosses for the CDU in state elections.Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva lastweekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the moreremarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, andwas appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier thisyear, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition governmentgave Poehl another eight-year term.Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said hehoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he wasnot only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating theBundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said.", "level4": ["interest", "money-fx"]}, {"title": "papers say venezuelan central bank chief to resign", "abstract": "Venezuelan Central Bank President HernanAnzola has submitted his resignation and asked President JaimeLusinchi to transfer him to a post in the oil industry, twoleading Venezuelan newspapers reported.The El Universal and El Nacional papers said Anzola wouldleave his position soon.
