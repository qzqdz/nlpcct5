But other businessmen said sucha short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed byfurther U.S. Pressure to block imports.\"That is a very short-term view,\" said Lawrence Mills,director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.\"If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it willbe extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kongis the disadvantage of action restraining trade,\" he said.The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong\\'s biggest export market,accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of tradetalks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern,Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.\"This kind of deterioration in trade relations between twocountries which are major trading partners of ours is a veryserious matter,\" Button said.He said Australia\\'s concerns centred on coal and beef,Australia\\'s two largest exports to Japan and also significantU.S. Exports to that country.Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve thetrade stand-off continue.Japan\\'s ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlineda package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.The measures proposed include a large supplementary budgetand record public works spending in the first half of thefinancial year.They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergencymeasure to stimulate the economy despite Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone\\'s avowed fiscal reform program.Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and MakotoKuroda, Japan\\'s deputy minister of International Trade andIndustry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in aneffort to end the dispute.',\n",

But he said the question was stillbeing considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and nodecision on when to go ahead had been made.The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubberphysicals on an open outcry system four days a week.\"Several factors make us move cautiously,\" Nainggolan said.\"We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make amistake and undermine confidence in the exchange.\"Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffeeadded in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up tofive months forward. Robusta coffee grades four and five aretraded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward,exchange officials said.The trade ministry and exchange board are considering theintroduction of futures trading later for rubber, but oneofficial said a feasibility study was needed first.

       "  'abstract': 'Sumitomo Bank Ltd &lt;SUMI.T> is certain tolose its status as Japan\\'s most profitable bank as a result ofits merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said.Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bankwith an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, inOctober.But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsutold Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain itsposition.\"We\\'ll be back in position in first place within threeyears,\" Komatsu said in an interview.He said that while the merger will initially reduceSumitomo\\'s profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expandSumitomo\\'s branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area whereit has been relatively weak.But financial analysts are divided on whether and howquickly the gamble will pay off.Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo inview of the smaller bank\\'s large debts. Others argue the mergerwas more cost effective than creating a comparable branchnetwork from scratch.The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It hasexpanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities businessand geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned thewisdom of some of those moves.\"They\\'ve made bold moves to put everything in place. Nowit\\'s largely out of their hands,\" said Kleinwort Benson Ltdfinancial analyst Simon Smithson.Among Sumitomo\\'s problems are limits placed on its move toenter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in Americaninvestment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being atleast, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchangepersonnel, or increase the business they do with each other.\"The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because theFed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,\" said one analyst.But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.\"U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,we can do various things. We only have to wait two or threeyears, not until the 21st century,\" Komatsu said.Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routesinto the securities business at home.Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan\\'sversion of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercialfrom investment banking.But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsusaid he hopes further deregulation will create newopportunities.\"We need to find new business chances,\" Komatsu said. \"In somecases these will be securities related, in some cases trustbank related. That\\'s the kind of deregulation we want.\"Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on suchdomestic securities business as profitable government bonddealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities CoLtd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about enteringthe securities business here through its Swiss universal banksubsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences tosecurities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,following a similar decision for subsidiaries of Europeanuniversal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similardecision on a Gottardo subsidiary.\"We don\\'t want to make waves. We expect this will be allowedin two or three years,\" he said.Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expandlending to individuals and small and medium businesses toreplace disappearing demand from big business, he added.The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot oftime to digesting its most recent initiatives, including themerger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.\"It\\'s (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,\" saidKleinwort\\'s Smithson.\"After that, it\\'s a question of absorbing and jugglingaround.

Some of that is endingup here with the attraction of high interest rates andreasonable currency stability,\" National Australia Bank Ltdeconomist Brian Hamley said.\"There is a \\'flight to quality\\',\" Hamley said. \"Australia maynot be in the best (economic) position, but there aren\\'t toomany other countries where you\\'d want to put your money.\"The stronger Australian dollar was also attractinginvestors taking advantage of an appreciating currency againstthe volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.\"We\\'re looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S.Where some people would be concerned about the value of theU.S. Dollar,\" Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrosesaid. \"Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheapand the currency looks stable?\"But turning that capital into more permanent productiveinvestment depends on government economic policy, he said.\"It will only disappear if people lose confidence in thedirection in the economy,\" Buttrose said, adding that offshoreinvestors would carefully watch the government\\'s promised tougheconomic statement on May 14.While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yieldinginterest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just aseasily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who werebadly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollarand hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.\"It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to bedelivered, if the statement wasn\\'t considered tough enough, onemight see a substantial outflow,\" Buttrose said.Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tougheconomic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt andstubborn current account deficit, analysts said.\"They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I thinkthey would like to leave the money here,\" Buttrose said.Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increasedinterest in investment in Australia and the need to shieldJapanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged anelement of targeting the rate against the yen in currencypolicy when he said authorities could not take their \"eyes offthe yen\" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors.Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had workedsuccessfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollarwithin the range of 100 to 103 yen.Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, theAustralian dollar has also risen almost three pct on atrade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.Offshore buying has also played a role in the boomingAustralian share market. It has followed Wall Street and othermarkets, but is also setting its own trend in response to theweight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring intoequities, particularly in the gold sector.The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, whilethe gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in thesame period.The property sector is also sought after, with Japanesecompanies that have invested heavily in the United States inrecent years turning their attention to undervalued realestate, particularly in the tourism field.Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney\\'s five-starRegent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrsas indicative of the type of property being sought.\"They think they find good value real estate here which,with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind ofinvestment Australia needs,\" Buttrose added.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Kuwait\\'s oil-reliant and debt-riddeneconomy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil priceswill determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economistssay.Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to holdoil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in thenorthern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of grossdomestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last yearafter contracting 8.1 pct the year before.This was after taking into account inflation in consumerprices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.Factors depressing economic activity include the6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait\\'s doorstep, whichthreatens the emirate\\'s vital oil export lifeline through theGulf and has sapped business confidence.But sentiment received a much-needed boost in Septemberwhen, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisiscaused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensivenew debt settlement program was introduced.The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forwardtrading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.The cheques were also used as collateral for consumerspending, thus generating an informal credit system.Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums arestill owed by individuals and companies.There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs)in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of whichone-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank asbad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said itwill not allow any banks to go under.The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling ofproblem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whetherdebtors have regular cash flows or not.Banks\\' shareholders and depositors will have their rightsguaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significancein a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sectoris the biggest after oil.Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to rideout the oil glut, bankers and economists say.Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned lastyear by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.But strategic diversification into downstream operations inEurope several years ago and a hefty refining investment athome gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sellover one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processedproduct such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than ascrude.Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reasonfor cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domesticinflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recentyears and signs government spending on productive sectors willremain steady.External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct belowthat for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hitGulf.Kuwait\\'s petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were putofficially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment incomeof the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, thesereserves may not be enough to prevent a \"real\" budget deficit forthe 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.This left out income from state reserves, usually excludedin official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers atup to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in someshortfall.Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast foreconomic growth this year or next.\"It depends on oil prices,\" one said. \"This summer isimportant.\"Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sundaythe cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise statespending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate theeconomy.He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to bespelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.',\n",

But we must be very careful,\" he said.He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan\\'strade surpluses, which affected European countries as well asthe United States.Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetaryofficials of major industrialized countries, saying theimportance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchangerates had been underestimated.All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about theright level, and that further changes would damage growth, hesaid.\"This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on thepart of our American colleagues,\" he said.But he said there was still a danger that the correction ofthe dollar\\'s value could overshoot.',\n",

Harvest will start in La Pampa andBuenos Aires in mid-April.The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mlntonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2mln tonne crop.The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of7.1 mln.The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mlnto 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mlnsown in 1985/86.The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in someareas and producers fear they may discover more damage.

The whole game is bringing out new products and improvingthe old ones.\"Analysts say the chemical industry\\'s biggest customers,automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot ofpaints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hikeproduct prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demandfor some products such as styrene could push profit margins upby as much as 300 pct, he said.Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers inHouston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earnedlast year and predicted it would have the best year in itshistory.In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barreland chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. \"I believe the entirechemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,\"Oreffice said.GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemicalindustry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billiondlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemicalindustry has been brought about by a combination of luck andplanning, said Pace\\'s John Dosher.Dosher said last year\\'s fall in oil prices made feedstocksdramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollarwas weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boostU.S. chemical exports.Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance hasbeen the gradual market absorption of the extra chemicalmanufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producersin the early 1980s.Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturershave embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring programto mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminateunrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry offriendly and hostile takeover attempts.GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquireUnion Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrsfor Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plasticsand chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA>has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizerbusinesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.But some experts worry that the chemical industry may beheaded for trouble if companies continue turning their back onthe manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such asethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals thatare custom-designed for a small group of buyers.\"Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent thepast two or three years trying to get out of the commoditychemical business in reaction to how badly the market haddeteriorated,\" Dosher said. \"But I think they will eventuallykill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the nichemarket.\" Some top chemical executives share the concern.\"The challenge for our industry is to keep from gettingcarried away and repeating past mistakes,\" GAF\\'s Heymancautioned. \"The shift from commodity chemicals may beill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long.\"Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by theSterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyoutof Dupont\\'s Conoco Inc\\'s chemical business, has spent 1.1billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plantsalong the Texas Gulf Coast.The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals thatare the building blocks of specialty products.\"This kind of commodity chemical business will never be aglamorous, high-margin business,\" Cain said, adding that demandis expected to grow by about three pct annually.Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, saidchemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand forplastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, woodand steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemicalbusiness could last as long as four or five years, provided theU.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.',\n",

Foreignexchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln andtrust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees andcommissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but netinvestment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the firstquarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fellto 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which meansthat interest can be recorded as income only when payments areactually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resumepayments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance forcredit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs comparedwith 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs aftercharge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a yearearlier.

The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande doSul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but wereresponsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-Westgrowing regions, where rising production has outpaced storagecapacity.Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya andmaize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grainsproduction but only 20 pct of its storage space.In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared tostoring grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable forstoring loose grain, Brito said.Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport thecrops.The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crophas been evident from television reports, which have shownenormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.\",\n",

Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman forMontreal-based Dominion called the report just \"rumors.\"Burlington said it did not know if the report was true.Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced ofthe story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors ifBurlington actually came into play.Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however,added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that itwas looking for a takeover in the U.S.Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Millsand has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used fora U.S. acquisition.A Dominion spokesman said Canada\\'s largest textile producerhas been negotiating with \"many\" U.S. textile companies, butwould not say whether Burlington was among them.\"There have been acquisitions in this area. It\\'s notunusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after thehousecleaning they\\'ve done,\" said Eileen Gormley of ThomsonMcKinnon.Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheetsand other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrslast year. It also has reorganized management, and focused itsoperations on businesses that would be less affected by foreigncompetition, Gormley said.\"They\\'ve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,\"said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrialfabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpetsand other fabric to the auto industry.\"In the past, they just spent and never realized the returnon the outlays they did make,\" she said.\"You look at their record over the year, and I thinkthey\\'re poised to be more profitable than they had been in thepast,\" Gormley said.She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, upfrom 2.01 dlrs per share.Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlingtonat its current levels.Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommendsselling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earningsbasis.Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have beenplaced on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.\"After Asher\\'s (Edelman) recent history, a lot of peopledon\\'t find him very credible anymore,\" said one arbitrager.Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcingmanagements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even ifhe doesn\\'t win the target company.Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for LuckyStores Inc and Fruehauf Corp.

       "  'abstract': 'Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hopedto maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth tothe 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despitecontinuing investments in a reorganization program and effortsto extend world penetration.Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mlnguilders, after 265 mln in 1985.Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe\\'sleading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986,said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S.,Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe,where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weakerforeign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.Further consolidation of foreign companies, including theincrease of its stake in leading Spanish brewery &lt;El AguilaS.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularlyin French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. Thecompany still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year inrestructuring and marketing, Heineken said.Heineken\\'s Spanish activities should start yielding profitnext year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations hadalready turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by theEuropean Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beerinto the closed West German market -- Europe\\'s biggest beermarket -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. \"Wehave the beer, but distribution and sales is the importantpoint,\" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heinekenhad been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.\"The question is not if we want to penetrate the Germanmarket, but how we are to do it,\" van Schaik said, adding thatwhile the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing ataste for foreign beer, the internal structure was veryregionalized.Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible forAfrican operations, said he saw Africa as one of the mostimportant beer growth markets in the long term.He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and withmajority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, washampered by the lack of hard currencies there.Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine litersper head per year and sales are limited by import restrictionsand currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total1986 sales.On-site production is rendered expensive by the high priceof imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientistshave been looking at other possibilities.To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched onthe Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, whichhad sold successfully, Coebergh said.Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional rawmaterials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer werepopular in Rwanda . \"This is a possibility, but we could notpossibly achieve the Heineken flavor,\" Coebergh said.Chairman Heineken said the company\\'s seven year efforts topenetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in acontract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken\\'smarket potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow thatare enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept westernmoney.',\n",

He said the first quarter resultsare in line with those expectations.General Electric cited the strong results in TV network andstation operations of the National Broadcasting Co, which wasnot part of GE in the first quarter of 1986, as one reason forits strong earnings.It also noted that aircraft engine operating profit wasmuch higher than a year ago, caused by a increase in shipmentsthan the 1986 quarter, which was impacted by a strike.Aerospace revenues were sharply higher in this year's firstquarter from a year ago, mainly because of the inclusion ofRCA's aerospace and defense business, the company said.In addition, consumer products revenues were up from lastyear, mainly because of including sales of RCA video products.General Electric said restructuring provisions of 308 mlndlrs before taxes to implement various strategic moves werecharged against operations in the first quarter of 1987.

But Volckerhas warned that a further fall in the dollar\\'s value is fraughtwith danger.Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation asimported goods become more expensive and chase away foreigncapital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with othermajor industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value ofthe dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange ratesshould be stabilized at around current levels.As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed totake steps to stimulate their economies and the United Statesagreed to cut its budget deficit.The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as away to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, isto reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.\"If you don\\'t deal with the budget deficit, everything elseyou do is going to be counterproductive,\" Volcker said in recenttestimony before the Senate Banking Committee.Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten thegovernment\\'s purse strings than have the Fed tighten the creditsupply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures orto assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the UnitedStates.Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off thecurrent modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressedthat any deficit reduction was better than none.But he said the size of the cuts under consideration werenot enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility itneeds to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollarfrom plunging further in world exchange markets.\"There\\'s no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but ifyour objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve theFed\\'s flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answeris, it\\'s not enough,\" Silvia told Reuters.The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government\\'smost vexing and persistent problems.The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yetlittle indication that this year\\'s figure will be any lower,though administration officials have predicted it will drop byabout 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year\\'s end.In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleepworrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from thefederal budget.On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is notattached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set forthe 1986-1991 period by last year\\'s Gramm-Rudman balancedbudget law.While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs fornext year\\'s federal deficit, both the House and Senate BudgetCommittees have conceded that their budget plans would fallshort of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.\"For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about themost you\\'re going to get\" out of Congress at the present time,said Touche Ross\\'s Collander. \"To do something more than thatwould be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult.\"Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end upshort of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.\"To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptablereduction level,\" he explained. \"Anything less than that will nowlook like a failure to Wall Street.\"The budget plan now under debate on the House floor wouldlower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the yearbeginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cuttingdefense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from theiranticipated spending levels for next year.The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit ofnearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in newtaxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.',\n",

He added that West German growth forecasts wouldhave to be revised downward because of the recent dollar dropto 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange marketshad parted company with transactions in goods, services andinvestments. It was the scale of speculative transactions thatdetermined market trends.Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates togrow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rateswould have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.\"In other words, the monetary policy measures required aredifferent from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result ofmounting economic activity,\" Koehler said.The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciationgoing by talking the dollar down posed problems.The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steeprise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the costof European imports. But the volume effect of falling importsto the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time tomake itself felt compared with the price effect.\"Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be goingfurther than would be necessary to adjust the current accountover the medium term,\" Koehler said.A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occuronly if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand shouldrise faster than GNP.\"In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,\" Koehler said.If a further appreciation of the dollar was to beprevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset byan inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..But only if there was an appropriate interest ratedifferential would Europe and Japan look for financialinvestment in the U.S.When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bankhad to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact itsmeasures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market ratesby operating on the open market rather than adjusting leadinginterest rates because of the signal this gives to the marketand its substantial impact on exchange rates.It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals ofprice stability, economic growth and full employment but alsoto tackle international problems like the exchange rateproblem, the debt problem and the current account problem.A strategy had to be designed that helped \"the safeguardingof non-inflationary economic growth in an internationalmonetary system largely free of disruptions,\" Koehler said.Given the system of floating exchange rates, it wasnecessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficedto tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates overthe next few years and intervention points should not be set,because they were only testing points for the market, he said.In order to keep the international monetary system free ofdisruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly butalso cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.',\n",

Many former bureaucrats became members ofthe influential political group, he added.The ministry also has power in the financial sector due tothe more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in thePostal Savings System, analysts said.MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulateinterest rates on small deposits, a key element in financialliberalisation, since the change would remove the PostalSavings System\\'s ability to offer slightly higher rates thanbanks, they said.Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT\\'sobstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterizedthe ministry as feudal.Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limitingcompetition and sheltering the former monopolies under itswing.

AEGON did not specify the loss.In the United States, revenue in guilders from health andlife insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a changein accounting for U.S. Annuities.AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personalinvestment influences that it should be accounted differentlyfrom the more traditional insurances.This change in accounting practice and another change toaccount for profits made on fixed interest investments,resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mlnguilders.AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profitswere slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initialcosts for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in TheHague.In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emergedin the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said.

       "  'abstract': 'The United States, which has longsought Japanese action to stimulate its economy, appears to besatisfied Tokyo\\'s latest package is a major development andallows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreementto stabilize currencies.Monetary sources said they believed that U.S. TreasurySecretary James Baker considered Tokyo\\'s package, announcedyesterday, to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy.But yesterday\\'s statement by seven leading industrialpowers endorses the yen\\'s rise from around 153 to the dollar,the level at the February 22 Paris Accord, to about 145 today.And the initial reaction of currency markets in the FarEast demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced thatcurrencies yet reflect economic fundamentals, even though thecountries appear to do so. The yen sank below 145 at one pointdespite intervention by the Bank of Japan.Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan\\'s Finance Minister, said themovement since Paris was consistent with currency tradingranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks.\"I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the pastseveral weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in thediscussions in Paris,\" Miyazawa said yesterday.The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs wasannounced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve ofMiyazawa\\'s departure for Washington, to attend yesterday\\'smeetings of leading industrial nations.In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action\"extraordinary and urgent\", the meeting reaffirmed the ParisAccord by noting that current exchange rates are within rangesbroadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, WestGermany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- thereforerepeated their willingness to continue close cooperation tofoster exchange rate stability.The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted centralbank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt thedollar\\'s fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale ofintervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recentyears. Monetary sources also said they understood thatSecretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremelysuccessful in the light of the Japanese announcement.They also said there was a growing feeling among thefinance ministers and central bankers that cooperation overmedium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-termdifferences in past meetings.West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything likethe yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face ofyesterday\\'s statement to have won acceptance from othercountries that its exchange rate is acceptable.Bonn\\'s finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues thatmajor currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalancebetween West Germany and Japan\\'s trade surpluses and America\\'strade deficit have already taken place.No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cutthe budget deficit even though it is implied in thereafffirmation of Paris.European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts areessential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall thatreached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier thisweek by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A furthersharp fall to redress trade imbalances would \"clearly posesubstantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and couldundermine confidence in future financial stability,\" he said.Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force thepolitically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germanywelcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its owncurrency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weakdollar blunts Tokyo\\'s export drive to the United States, theJapanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on makingtheir policy coordination more binding and one, CanadianFinance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summitto prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.The United States and France, backed by the InternationalMonetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or \"norms\" for alimited number of economic objectives such as growth,inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and currentaccount balances.Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result inconsultations between the countries on whether correctiveaction should be required.But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectiveshas Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because itimplies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfullysounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limitcurrency fluctuations just before the February meeting.The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret rangesof the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from therelatively free currency markets of recent years.',\n",

They had hoped that new vitality in theindustrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oilprices would assist their economic recovery and help them copewith growing mounds of debt.IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believedthe industrial country economies would move up to an annualgrowth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for sometime that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning intoan economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthierstates for markets for their products as well as financialassistance, economic weakness in the developed nations\\'economies poses fundamental worries.Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, haveonly a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,including the key one of exports.The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but ittoo is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only2.3 pct, according to the IMF.For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, theUnited States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany toignite their economies but with little apparent success.The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar andthe curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. tradedeficit.Reagan administration officials have been saying that theimpact is now beginning to show up, although it has been muchslower than expected.The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that \"it hasto be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time towork through to payments flows -- probably at least three yearsto get a resonably complete effect.\"The report added, however, \"the adjustments may take evenmore time on this occasion.\"REUTER^M',\n",

The government's perceived need to control inflation bykeeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.High real interest rates were attracting an influx ofspeculative foreign capital which was undercutting thegovernment's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply,liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and atarget range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call moneyrate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from11.8 at end-1986.Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call tohold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and newwage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanishworkers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected thestate sector, where the government is trying to impose its fivepct wage ceiling.Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend inSpain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the firsttwo months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pctincrease over the corresponding period last year.However, employers did not favour a devaluation of thepeseta to correct the imbalance.\",\n",

Although the company said it would meetcommitments, this will put further pressure on stocks.And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnesper year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocksand contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within theU.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production anda regular supplier to the world market.Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks,have been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said.On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held upquite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reportedin the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in thefirst two months of the year, was resumed when a large buyingorder was filled by merchants in March.Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead pricesthis week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg andestablish a premium of around 10 stg over three monthsdelivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal inGothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is oftena target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said.On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerpand Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each,and this is believed to be in strong hands.Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowestlevel since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouseswhich are not popular with merchants putting togethershipments.But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes sincethe start of the year. Traders said this is partly due tosecondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed suppliesaffected by environmental controls, which put restrictions onthe transport of used batteries.Labour negotiations in North America will play an importantpart in determining the direction of prices, with contractsexpiring end-April at Cominco's Trail and Kimberley, B.C.,Mine/smelter and at Doe Run's Herculaneum, Mo, smelter.Noranda's New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contractexpiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view ofstrikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months.Traders said LME three months delivery, already attractingspeculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on currentfirmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premiumto 20 from four.

Analysts have described the helddividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5billion marks, with the result that its total dividend paymenton 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985,since the new capital was in preference shares.The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves inorder to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. Atthe end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightlyless than three billion marks.',\n",

Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today,could go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said.Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987,before special gains from recouped investment tax credits,against losses last year.Armco\\'s 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, hesaid.Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. \"We had a buyon it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else haveit,\" he said.The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr ashare in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, andfrom two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. \"But a lotdepends on oil prices,\" he added. About 60 pct of USX\\'s salescome from oil and natural gas.Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum ofSalomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. \"The company\\'s done a lot(of restructuring), more than the market\\'s given them creditfor,\" she said.She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX wastrading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. She predicts USX will earn 18 cts ashare this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in1986.Applebaum, who is also positive on Armco and Inland, hasbeen recommending the stocks since last November.Peter Marcus of Painewebber Inc is neutral on the groupalthough he said the earnings outlook is improved through thethird quarter.But he sees potential trouble beyond then. \"I think (steel)prices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer,\"he said.Applebaum of Salomon Brothers also sees some seasonaldropoff later in the year. \"But there are more positives thannegatives,\" she said, citing reduced capacity in the domesticindustry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which shouldcause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.',\n",

We arestill awaiting their decision,\" he added, asking not to beidentified.Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes ofhigh-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country hadspent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences andupgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules.Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will beforced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at lowprices, the source said.

Thestockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to managethe stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.These agencies included the Office of Management and Budgetand the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpilemanagement was counter-productive, he said.',\n",

Lichtblau, president of Petroleum IndustryResearch Associates.Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conferencehere, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as muchas 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous highlevel of 47 pct in 1977.\"The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil isinevitable,\" Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oilimports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to40 pct by 1990.\"However, the rate of this growth can be affectedpositively or negatively through government action orinaction,\" Lichtblau said.He said that one of the government\\'s negative actions isthe maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as adisincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cashflow for oil exploration.Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floorprice for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.\"An international floor price adopted by all or mostindustrial countries would clearly be a much more effectivemeasure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than ifwe imposed it alone,\" Lichtblau said.Development of alternate energy sources such as syntheticfuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessenU.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.A potential for alternative supplies could limit thewillingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offertax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the StrategicPetroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plansfor alternative energy.',\n",

Wednesday borrowings were1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.\"One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but itprobably isn\\'t,\" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policymodestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in thetwo-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averagingaround 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latesttwo-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demandoften pushes up borrrowings.\"Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but itlooks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisionslate in the statement period and didn\\'t quite make it,\" saidWard McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today thatthe Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs ormore in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss inits estimates over the week that caused it to add fewerreserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.The Fed took no market reserve management action lastThursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It addedtemporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs ofcustomer repurchase agreements and then supplied reservesdirectly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that thetwo-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged onTuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday\\'sovernight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.\"It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy atthis time,\" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzisaid the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interestrates to help the dollar because that would harm already weakeconomies in the United States and abroad and add to thefinancial stress of developing countries and their lenders.\"Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the lateststatement period have to explain why it acted before the dollartumbled,\" said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a newstatement period began today on disappointment yesterday\\'sWashington meetings of international monetary officials failedto produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing inWednesday\\'s G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view thatthe yen needs to rise further to redress the huge tradeimbalance between the United States and Japan.The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming forsteady policy now that should correspond to a weekly averageFed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about wherethe rate has been since early November.\"I\\'m not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighterpolicy to help the dollar, as some suspect,\" said Sullivan ofDean Witter.If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has justnudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct fromsix to 6.10 pct previously.',\n",

Interest rates fellsharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.But that confidence is now cracking as the financialmarkets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker\\'soften-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.\"Volcker\\'s been saying for a long time that a dollarfreefall would be extremely dangerous - now he\\'s got it,\" saidDavid Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washingtonfailed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have acredible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, shortof further depreciation of the dollar.Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amidworries that the dollar\\'s slide will rekindle inflation, scareaway foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spikein interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average downby 33 points to 2339.Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called themarkets\\' instability frightening. He believes economicfundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that \"onceyou start the ball rolling it\\'s difficult to stop.\"\"There\\'s a stark possibility that you could get adestabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest ratesand drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic.\"Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economicsin Washington, has been warning for a long time that thecontrolled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.\"We\\'re still more or less on track for a hard landing... Butthe agony may be fairly drawn out,\" Marris told Reuters.Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later thisyear, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that itwould take very little to touch off what he calls the secondphase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in thedollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.The stock market\\'s reaction today and its sharp drop onMarch 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent withhistorical experience, which teaches that domestic markets arenot affected until a currency is in the final stages of itsdecline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar\\'s latestweakness was the loss of credibility that central bankssuffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from fallingbelow 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set aspart of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss ofconfidence was triggered last week when Washington announcedplans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronicimports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.Many economists believe that long-run stability will notreturn to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap isaddressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in themassive budget deficit.But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and ofcentral bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have nochoice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.\"The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is asubstantial increase in the discount rate and a correspondingcut abroad, at least by Japan,\" said Lanston\\'s Jones.Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interestrates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden forAmerican farmers, Latin American governments and others.But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs andCo, scoffed at the notion. \"It\\'s ridiculous to think the FederalReserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weakagainst just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollarweakness,\" he said.Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress beingmade toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.\"We\\'re going to have one of the biggest reductions in thebudget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobodycares,\" he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69will have been greater.He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse andthinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly thata further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. \"Put onyour helmets,\" Giordano said.',\n",

That distaste stems in part from fears of recession.Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman toldtelevision interviewers he did not think a policy of drivingthe dollar down would solve the U.S. trade deficit.\"It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which wouldadversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it woulddrive interest rates up here which would throw us, if not(into) recession, into slower growth,\" he said.Asked if higher U.S. Interest rates would stabilize thedollar, Balladur said: \"When a currency is maintainedartificially high, by artificially high interest rates, it isnot healthy.\"And resorting to higher interest rates could lead torecession, he said.Acknowledging the dollar\\'s latest slide was now a fact oflife, Balladur said, \"there may be adjustments of course in oneor other currencies, this is not a fixed rate system.\"But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said hemight rein in credit if the dollar\\'s slide deepens.U.S. Monetary sources also said Washington wanted itunderstood by markets the seven\\'s commitments were genuine.\"The United States and the six major industrial countriesare fully committed to implementing our undertakings in theseagreements,\" Baker told the meetings.Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets whichwrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a furtherdecline in the dollar. Baker, Darman said, was committed tostabilizing currencies at current levels.Last week\\'s statement from the seven reaffirmed a February22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreedto reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fightprotectionism.West Germany and Japan, meanwhile, agreed to stimulatedomestic demand and lead a global upturn.Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japan\\'spromise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget.The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a majoraction. But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stablecurrencies applied to today\\'s exchange rates and not those atthe time of the Paris agreement, when the dollar stood higher.The Paris accord said, \"currencies (are) within rangesbroadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals, giventhe policy commitments summarized in this statement.\"Now they accept the dollar\\'s lower level, especiallyagainst the yen, as hard reality that is nonetheless consistentwith the agreement. \"The ministers and governors reaffirmed theview that around current levels their currencies are withinranges broadly consistent with fundamentals,\" last week\\'sstatement read.Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets werefocusing on instability created by the gap between the U.S.Trade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japanrather than prospective policy changes.

Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surgein economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largelyunderpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts.Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank ofPortugal forecast, released on the day the PSD government fell,predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growthwould remain at similar levels this year.But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policiesand could slow economic development.Soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the endof the month, can either call early elections or form a newgovernment from parties in the existing left wing-dominatedparliament.Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quickelections as the best solution. \"There is a good chance that amajority government could result from early elections,\"Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president PedroFerraz da Costa said.He said they were optimistic this could mean thecontinuation in the near future of liberalisation policiesintroduced over the last year.The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, butthe PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion pollssay they could win an overall majority.A PSD majority would also open the way for morewide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws andpossible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said.Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition partiesof blocking key economic reforms.The left-wingers said Portugal\\'s positive economic resultswere more the product of favourable international conditionssuch as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of PSDpolicies.',\n",

But experience hasshown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a pricerise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy.Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears mayseem exaggerated, they said.\"But it has often turned out in the past that the priceclimate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank intoa restrictive policy,\" they said.The economic costs of a preventive stability policy areless than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.The four institutes disputed the view that monetaryexpansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domesticinvestors switch liquidity into longer term capital marketinvestments following lower interest rates.\"Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion ofcentral bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to asmaller expansion of money supply,\" they said.A return to growth and stability did not requirespectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly withopen market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoidan interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.The DIW institute said monetary policy should not befocused simply on growth of production potential. Because ofuncertainty about exchange rate developments and economicweakness other factors should be taken into account.Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cutsand avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluationspeculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threatin itself to price stability.The 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growthreflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and thefalling mark.',\n",

They said even if GAF raises its offerand does not succeed, a higher bid from another company wouldgive GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock.\"It\\'s a win-win situation,\" said one analyst.One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would beforthcoming shortly.\"I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in thisbook,\" he said.Borg-Warner\\'s other businesses include automotive parts,protective services, which includes Wells Fargo securityguards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who followsGAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, itwould realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 pershare.\"I think there\\'s a probability he goes up in price,\" saidRose.Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heymanwould do. \"Sam\\'s a low-risk, high-return player.\"\"Is he trying to build a major industrial chemicalenterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank,\" Rosesaid.Analysts said Borg-Warner\\'s chemical business would addearnings momentum to GAF. \"I worked out that paying as much as50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, ifthey sold off most of the non-chemical facilities,\" said JohnHenry of E.F.

That spread has narrowed again.\"A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,\"said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc.Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct isjustified because the spread between banks\\' cost of funds andthe prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of apercentage point.He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentagepoints since last October until it fell below one point andtriggered the April prime rate rise at most banks.\"We could easily have another prime rate increase as soonas this week,\" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.\"We\\'ve got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in thenear future,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.\"Based on the spread between the prime rate and fundingcosts, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,\"said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the primebecause that would dampen already fairly weak business loandemand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintainrecent upward pressure on money market interest rates.Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures liftshort-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. Hesaid \"if there is widespread belief money market rates willstay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time.\"Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep adollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollarfell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traderssaid the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar.In addition to buying dollars outright, another way tostabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S.interest rates higher relative to overseas rates.Based particularly on the Fed\\'s reserve management actionson Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said \"it has becomeclear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressurein the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed.\"Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interestrates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculationthat the Fed is gently firming monetary policy.That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in themarket than most economists had expected.On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in smallamounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreementswith the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one anotherhigh at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pcttoday, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlrround of customer repurchase agreements.\"The Fed\\'s actions on Friday and today show that it isoffering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,\"said Jones of Lanston.\"The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on theneed to defend the dollar,\" Jones said. He believes it ismerely shading policy toward restraint now, \"but to have amajor impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policyovertly at some point.\"Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates bybecoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, withinfour to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct mightwell be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts tofurther aid the dollar.Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime ratemay be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year\\'s end.\"The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tighteningpolicy to defend the dollar,\" said Leslie of Discount Corp.
